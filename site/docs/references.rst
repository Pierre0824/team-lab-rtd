References and Source Material
==============================

This guide is based on official F5 documentation, DevCentral guidance, and iHealth diagnostics.
The following references provide authoritative background and technical details for the
Control-Plane Security Onion framework.

These sources define best practices for securing BIG-IP management interfaces and validating
security posture.

Advanced Security and Appliance Mode
------------------------------------

* **K12815 – Enabling Appliance Mode**  
* **K12173 – Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
* **K73034260 – Hardware Security Modules (HSM) and SecureVault**  
* **K11438344 – Control-plane incident response planning**  

These articles align with the Core Layer controls for least privilege, secret protection, and incident readiness.

iHealth Diagnostics and Validation
----------------------------------

* **F5 iHealth Portal** – https://ihealth.f5.com  
* **QKView Security Best Practices Panel documentation**  
* **D006068 – Login banner configuration diagnostic**  
* **D009908 – Idle logout configuration diagnostic**  
* **D012815 – Appliance mode diagnostic**  
* **D015632 – Admin and root account diagnostic**  
* **H444724 – Management interface public access heuristic**  
* **H494013 – Password policy strength heuristic**  
* **H726514 – NTP configuration heuristic**  

These diagnostics provide automated validation for the Security Onion framework.

DevCentral Community Resources
------------------------------

* DevCentral Security Best Practices articles  
* BIG-IP hardening blogs and whitepapers  
* Community lab guides and tutorials  
* F5 training and certification resources  

DevCentral serves as a knowledge-sharing platform for operational and security best practices.

---

Standards and Security Frameworks (Informational)
-------------------------------------------------

The Security Onion model aligns with common security frameworks, including:

* NIST SP 800-53 – Security and Privacy Controls  
* CIS Benchmarks – Network Device Hardening  
* Zero Trust Architecture principles  
* Defense-in-depth security strategy  

These frameworks reinforce the layered approach used in this guide.

Usage Notes
-----------

This guide consolidates and organizes existing F5 guidance into a layered control-plane
security framework.

Always refer to the latest official F5 documentation and security advisories for current
recommendations, software updates, and vulnerability information.
