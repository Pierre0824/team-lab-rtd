F5 Control-Plane Security Onion: A Layered Defense Strategy Using the Rule of Threes

This security onion model organizes control-plane hardening into three layers, progressing from the outer (easiest, most effective) to the core (more complex, higher maintenance).

Control-Plane Definition
------------------------

According to the DevCentral Security Best Practices article:

"The control-plane includes all methods for managing a device or installation, such as the Web UI (TMUI), iControl REST, iControl SOAP, SSH, and related daemons like big3d and bigd."

This guide focuses exclusively on securing these management interfaces and administrative access methods.

Key Takeaway
------------

This layered approach ensures progressive enhancement of control-plane security posture, starting with quick wins and advancing to defense-in-depth controls.

Note: This onion focuses exclusively on control-plane security. Data-plane protections are not included.
